Introduction to AI
                                                                                
AI is a branch of Science that deals with helping machines find solutions to complex problems in a more human-like fashion. technology is growing very fast, and we are getting in touch with different new technologies day by day. we can create software or devices that can solve real-world problems very easily and with accuracies such as health issues, marketing, and traffic issues, you can create your virtual Assistant. Intelligence is intangible.
It has defined intelligence in terms of:
1.	Human Performance 
2.	Rationality 
3.	Loosely thought processes
4.	Behavior

AI Perspectives
                                                                                
Acting humanly: The Turing test approach: the Turing Test is a method of inquiry in artificial intelligence (AI) for determining whether or not a computer is capable of thinking like a human being. Turing proposed that a computer can be said to possess artificial intelligence if it can mimic human responses under specific conditions. The original Turing Test requires three terminals, each of which is physically separated from the other two. One terminal is operated by a computer, while the other two are operated by humans.
Features of Turing Test:
1.	It attempts to give an objective notion of intelligence,
2.	It prevents us from being sidetracked
3.	It eliminates any bias in favor of living organisms

Thinking humanly: The cognitive modeling approach:
For Machines to think, we would need:
1.	natural language processing
2.	knowledge representation
3.	automated reasoning
4.	machine learning

Acting rationally: The rational agent approach:
Agents: An agent is just something that acts. Computer agents are expected to do more: operate autonomously, perceive their environment, persist over a prolonged time period, adapt to change, and create and pursue goals.
Rational Agents: A rational agent is one that acts so as to achieve the best outcome or when there is uncertainty,
the best-expected outcome. About human thought in three ways:
1.	introspection—trying to catch our own thoughts as they go by
2.	psychological experiments—observing a person in action
3.	brain imaging—observing the brain in action.

Thinking rationally: The “laws of thought” approach:
AI uses symbolic logic to capture the laws of rational thought as symbols that can be manipulated. Reasoning involves manipulating the symbols according to well-defined rules, kind of like algebra. The result is an idealized model of human reasoning.
(Acting, Thinking) (rationally, humanly)

History of Artificial Intelligence
                                                                
a brief timeline of the past six decades of how AI evolved from its inception.
1956 - John McCarthy coined the term ‘artificial intelligence and had the first AI conference.
1969 - Shakey was the first general-purpose mobile robot built. It is now able to do things with a purpose vs. just a list of instructions.
1997 – The supercomputer ‘Deep Blue’ was designed, and it defeated the world champion chess player in a match. It was a massive milestone for IBM to create this large computer.
2002 - The first commercially successful robotic vacuum cleaner was created. 
2005 - 2019 - Today, we have speech recognition, robotic process automation (RPA), a dancing robot, smart homes, and other innovations making their debut.
2020 - Baidu releases the LinearFold AI algorithm to medical and scientific and medical teams developing a vaccine during the early stages of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic. The algorithm can predict the RNA sequence of the virus in only 27 seconds, which is 120 times faster than other methods. 

Foundations of AI

Philosophy:
Can formal rules be used to draw valid conclusions?
How does the mind arise from a physical brain?
Where does knowledge come from?
How does knowledge lead to action?

Economics:
•	How should we make decisions so as to maximize payoff?
•	How should we do this when others may not go along?
•	How should we do this when the payoff may be far in the future?
Utility, Decision Theory, Game Theory, and Operations Research.

Psychology:
•	How do humans and animals think and act?
Behaviorism, Cognitive psychology.
•	The three key steps of a knowledge-based agent:
I. the stimulus must be translated into an internal representation
II. the representation is manipulated by cognitive processes to derive internal representations
III. These are in turn retranslated back into action.

Sociology:
It includes methods of analyzing social data that use Artificial Intelligence (AI) to further its work. With the advent of AI and consequent development, sociologists have engaged in the implementation of the same to understand social phenomena.
Linguistics:
•	How does language relate to thought?
•	Verbal Behavior — behaviorist approach to language learning
Computational linguistics or natural language processing and knowledge representation.

Neuroscience:
•	How do brains process information?
Neuroscience is the study of the nervous system, especially the brain. We are still a long way from understanding how cognitive processes actually work. The truly amazing conclusion is that a collection of simple cells can lead to thought, action, and consciousness or, brains cause minds. The only real alternative theory is mysticism: that minds operate in some mystical realm that is beyond physical science.

Mathematics:
•	What are the formal rules to draw valid conclusions?
•	What can be computed?
•	How do we reason with uncertain information?
The main three fundamental areas are logic, computation, and probability. Algorithm, incompleteness theorem, computable, tractability, NP-completeness, Nondeterministic polynomial, and probability.
Computer Science:
•	How can we build an efficient computer?
 Operational computer and operational programmable computer.AI has pioneered many ideas that have made their way back to mainstream computer science, including time-sharing, interactive interpreters, personal computers with windows and mice, rapid development environments, the linked list data type, automatic storage management, and key concepts of symbolic, functional, declarative, and object-oriented programming.
Control theory
•	How can artifacts operate under their own control?
 control Theory, Homeostatic and objective function.
